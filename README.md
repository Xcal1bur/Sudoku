# Description

> "Sudoku is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle. The objective is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 subgrids that compose the grid (also called "boxes", "blocks", or "regions") contain all of the digits from 1 to 9. The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid, which for a well-posed puzzle has a single solution." (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku, 2020.03.02 : 18:52) 

The program aims to solve a given sudoku riddle by brute forcing and backtracking. It will also feature Sudoku generation in the future.
